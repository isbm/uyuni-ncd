description: This is a test state

# The state itself starts from the root "state".
state:
  # At this level are state groups.
  # State groups are running asynchronously from each other.
  # An ID of the group, just like an ID of the state with the same rules.

  gather-machine-summary:
    # LIST of modules. Currently only one module is implemented: "shell"

    # The "shell" module is called either locally or over SSH with all the connectivity
    # from the nanostate (passwords or pubkeys, fqdn etc).
    # Here it only receives a series of actual commands on a target machine.
    # Each "shell" module opens an SSH connection (if remote) and runs command list chain
    # in the SSH channel sessions, combining the response into a JSON map.
    # It doesn't make much sense to list up few "shell" modules at this point,
    # but better to call one and pile up commands in one cycle instead.
